This repository contains hooks for use with [pre-commit](pre-commit.com).

## Using pre-commit-tool-hooks with pre-commit

Add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/google/pre-commit-tool-hooks
  rev: v1.0.0 # Use the rev you want to point at.
  hooks:
      - id: check-copyright
      # - id: ...
```

## Hooks

### check-copyright

Verifies that files contain a copyright statement. Looks for a Google Apache 2.0
license by default. To customize, pass `--copyright=<text>`, using `YYYY` for
year substitution.

```yaml
- id: check-copyright
  args:
      - --copyright
      - |+
          Copyright YYYY my organization
          with multiple lines

```
